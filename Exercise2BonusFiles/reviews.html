            <p>From  imdb -
            A mature exploration of social themes and personal growth disguised as a children's adventure show.
            The depth and originality of Steven Universe makes it one of the greatest series ever produced, ultimately coming to a conclusion that leaves the audience feeling satisfied that a well-told story has ended properly -- a true rarity in North American television.

            <p>From Imdb-   A Feel Good Show
            Currently tied with Gravity Falls for third on my kiddos' all-time favorite animated series list (behind Avatar and Voltron). The ten-minute segments take some getting used to but the creators do a good job of making each one a coherent episode; best consumed in quantities of 3 though!

            <p>From Common sense media - Steven universe.
            Steven Universe is a great show that has a lot of different cool aspects about it. I would recommend it to anyone. Although I will say that there are some LBGTQ+IA references throughout the show, parents if you do not want your children exposed to this yet than I would not recommend some episodes. I think its a great show though and kids would definitely enjoy it!
