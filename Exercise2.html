    <h2>Main Characters</h2>
        <h3>Steven Universe</h3>
            <p>-Steven Quartz Universe is the titular main protagonist of the Steven Universe franchise. He is the son of Greg Universe and Rose Quartz/Pink Diamond, the only known hybrid of a human and a Gem and the first Crystal Gem of human descent. As a result of his parentage, Steven is an extraordinarily unique being with innate powers beyond that of normal humans and Gems. While he was only a child, Steven steadily grew from a tag-along to the Crystal Gems into the heart of the team thanks to his kind-hearted nature and resourcefulness.</p>
        <h3>Garnet</h3>
            <p>-Garnet is the fusion of Ruby and Sapphire and the current de facto leader of the Crystal Gems. Garnet is one of the last surviving Gems on Earth who joined the Crystal Gems in the Rebellion against the Gem Homeworld and afterward assisted her friends in protecting the Earth over the next few millennia. After Rose Quartz gave up her physical form to give birth to her son, Steven Universe, Garnet took over as the leader of the group.</p>
        <h3>Amethyst</h3>
            <p>-Amethyst (specifically Amethyst Facet-5 Cut-8XM) is a member of the Crystal Gems. She is the last known Gem manufactured on Earth as a part of the Gem Homeworld's Kindergarten project, being one of the last surviving Gems on Earth. After being found by Rose Quartz and the other Crystal Gems, Amethyst helped her friends protect the Earth over the next four millennia, and often aids in the shenanigans of Steven Universe.</p>
        <h3>Pearl</h3>
            <p>-Pearl is a member of the Crystal Gems. She was Pink Diamond's second Pearl, and one of Rose Quartz's closest followers and her sole confidant. Pearl is one of the last surviving Gems on Earth who joined the Crystal Gems in their rebellion against the Gem Homeworld. Pearl would afterward protect the Earth over the next several millennia alongside her friends, while later teaching Steven the ways of Gems.</p>

    <h2>Reviews</h2>
        <p>From  imdb -
        A mature exploration of social themes and personal growth disguised as a children's adventure show.
        The depth and originality of Steven Universe makes it one of the greatest series ever produced, ultimately coming to a conclusion that leaves the audience feeling satisfied that a well-told story has ended properly -- a true rarity in North American television.
        </p>

        <p>From Imdb-   A Feel Good Show
        Currently tied with Gravity Falls for third on my kiddos' all-time favorite animated series list (behind Avatar and Voltron). The ten-minute segments take some getting used to but the creators do a good job of making each one a coherent episode; best consumed in quantities of 3 though!
        </p>

        <p>From Common sense media - Steven universe.
        Steven Universe is a great show that has a lot of different cool aspects about it. I would recommend it to anyone. Although I will say that there are some LBGTQ+IA references throughout the show, parents if you do not want your children exposed to this yet than I would not recommend some episodes. I think its a great show though and kids would definitely enjoy it!
